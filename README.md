Used several system calls such as fork, exec, dup2, etc for process creation, redirection, piping

Also used signals (SIGINT, SIGTSTP, SIGCHLD) to send processes to foreground and background and for terminating, pausing, recontinuing a process.

Gained understanding in how shells operate in managing user commands and in linux editors (vim, emacs) and debuggers (gdb)
